This code oriented, first post of my blog hopes to give an example of the FubuMVC Html Conventions I've developed for our customer facing portal at <a href="http://www.is3.com/">iS3. Inc</a>.  These conventions came as a result of iS3's efforts to make a single customer facing portal for all our brands. So, we took this opportunity to migrate all of our Spark Engine views and hardcoded styles and Html to Razor Views, utilizing FubuMVC's InputFor(), LabelFor(), etc. to take advantage of Html Conventions.  While writing these conventions, I found it difficult to find many code samples online, so I hope these help those that wish to do the same. Below you can find the Gist for our Html Conventions as they stand:  <br/> <script src="https://gist.github.com/2776025.js?file=SampleHtmlConvention"></script> <script src="https://gist.github.com/2776025.js?file=Attributes"></script> <script src="https://gist.github.com/2776025.js?file=Bootstrapping"></script> <script src="https://gist.github.com/2776025.js?file=Usage"></script>
