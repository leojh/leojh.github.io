A very common web UI task that we are tasked with are dual combo boxes.&nbsp;These are very good if you want to manipulate or assign several items at once.<br /><br />Below is a working sample of a Knockout JS way of doing one of these. I really like the result of using an MVVM framework to do these because the whole select -&gt; option DOM manipuation is completely removed from us, Knockout takes care of that part. As a result, we are no longer using tons of jQuery magic; instead, we are dealing with the actual objects that will ultimately be sent over the wire.<br /><br />&nbsp;Enjoy<br />&nbsp;  <iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="http://jsfiddle.net/LeoJH/CeKyn/embedded/" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></iframe>
