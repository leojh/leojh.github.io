<br>

I am a software engineer living in South Florida, working mostly on .Net and [Ember](http://emberjs.com){:target="_blank"}.

I've also done some talks on Javascript as a member of the [Boca Raton Javascript Group](http://www.meetup.com/Boca-JS/){:target="_blank"}.

I'm involved in the community by doing my small part to help OSS project, teaching programming, and
supporting my local tech community.

My main focus is business application development.
